WPTE 2022 (affiliated to FSCD 2022, part of FLoC 2022, Haifa, Israel)

9th International Workshop on Rewriting Techniques for Program
Transformations and Evaluation (July 31st, 2022)

Web:         https://wpte2022.github.io/
Submit:      https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wpte2022
Deadline:    10 May 2022 (extended)
Publication: post-proceedings as a special issue in the Journal of
             Logical and Algebraic Methods in Programming for selected
             papers

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The aim of WPTE is to bring together the researchers working on
program transformations, evaluation, and operationally based
programming language semantics, using rewriting methods, in order to
share the techniques and recent developments and to exchange ideas to
encourage further activation of research in this area.

List of Topics
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Correctness of program transformations, optimizations and translations.
* Program transformations for proving termination, confluence, and
 other properties.
* Correctness of evaluation strategies.
* Operational semantics of programs, operationally-based program
 equivalences such as contextual equivalences and bisimulations.
* Cost-models for arguing about the optimizing power of transformations
 and the costs of evaluation.
* Program transformations for verification and theorem proving purposes.
* Translation, simulation, equivalence of programs with different
 formalisms, and evaluation strategies.
* Program transformations for applying rewriting techniques to programs
 in specific programming languages.
* Program transformations for program inversions and program synthesis.
* Program transformation and evaluation for Haskell and rewriting.

Submission Guidelines
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
For the paper submission deadline an extended abstract of at most 10
pages is required. The extended abstract may present original work,
but also work in progress. Based on the submissions the program
committee will select the presentations for the workshop. All selected
contributions will be included in the informal proceedings distributed
to the workshop participants. One author of each accepted extended
abstract is expected to present it at the workshop. Submissions must
be prepared in LaTeX using the EPTCS macro package. All submissions
will be electronic via
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wpte2022.

Formal Proceedings
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
For the 2020 and 2021 editions, WPTE post-proceedings of selected
papers are scheduled to be published in JLAMP special issues. We are
delighted that the 2022 workshop will continue this tradition. Based
on the quality of the submission and the presentation, we will invite
a selection of papers to be published in extended form in a special
issue of the Journal of Logical and Algebraic Methods in Programming.
