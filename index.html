<h1>
WPTE 2022

9th International Workshop on Rewriting Techniques for Program Transformations and Evaluation
</h1>

<h2>
About
</h2>

<p>
The aim of WPTE is to bring together the researchers working on program transformations, evaluation, and operationally based programming language semantics, using rewriting methods, in order to share the techniques and recent developments and to exchange ideas to encourage further activation of research in this area.
</p>
